# Git LFS

  I'm Putting this here because it bit me: If you want to use git LFS, make sure that your hosting
  provider makes those images available during the build process.  Netlify, for example, does not.
  You won't find this out until you have gone through the entire migration process and try to deploy
  for the first time.
