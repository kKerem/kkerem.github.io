# Base Image (Required)

Can be any raster image (as long as you have the required ImageMagick delegate).
Relative to Jekyll's root directory, or the `source` [setting]({{ site.baseurl
}}/users/configuration/directories) if you've configured it.

For filenames with spaces, either use double quotes (`"my image.jpg"`) or a
backslash (`my\ image.jpg`).
