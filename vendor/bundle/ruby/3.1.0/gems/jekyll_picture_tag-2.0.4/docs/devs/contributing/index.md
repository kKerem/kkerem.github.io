# Contributing

Bug reports, feature requests, and feedback are very welcome, either through
github issues or via email: robert@buchberger.cc 

Pull requests are encouraged! I'm happy to answer questions and provide
assistance along the way.  Don't let any of the recommendations/requests in this
guide stop you from submitting one.

I think one of the biggest opportunities for improvement in this plugin is its
documentation. I'd really love help here, and all you need to know is markdown.
